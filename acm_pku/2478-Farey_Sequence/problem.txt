Description
The Farey Sequence Fn for any integer n with n >= 2 is the set of irreducible rational numbers a/b with 0 < a < b <= n and gcd(a,b) = 1 arranged in increasing order. The first few are
F2 = {1/2}
F3 = {1/3, 1/2, 2/3}
F4 = {1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4}
F5 = {1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5}

You task is to calculate the number of terms in the Farey sequence Fn.

Input
There are several test cases. Each test case has only one line, which contains a positive integer n (2 <= n <= 106). There are no blank lines between cases. A line with a single 0 terminates the input.

Output
For each test case, you should output one line, which contains N(n) ---- the number of terms in the Farey sequence Fn.
