stable version.

To install, simply use ``pip``:

*Note*: Python headers are required to install `psutil`_. For example,
on Debian/Ubuntu you need to install first the *python-dev* package.
For Fedora/CentOS/RHEL install first *python-devel* package. For Windows,
just install PsUtil from the binary installation file.

You can also install the following libraries in order to use optional
features (like the Web interface, export modules...):
